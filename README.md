# coffee-shop-data-analysis

We are commissioned by a coffee shop owner to analyse some data provided by them and help them in their planning for the next academic year. The coffee shop is located on campus and is open from 8am till 6pm on weekdays (Monday to Friday) and 10am till 4pm at the weekends (Saturday and Sunday).
We are asked to analyse 4 different datasets which are divided into 5 major tasks and sub- tasks. We will investigate each dataset and the task associated to it one by one.

**Key points:**

▪ Utilised R Studio to analyse coffee shop data and gain insights to compile a business report.

▪ Performed hypothesis tests to identify peak hours to optimise staff and resource allocation.

▪ Implemented multiple linear regression to find the best model (using lm and step function) for predicting daily income.
